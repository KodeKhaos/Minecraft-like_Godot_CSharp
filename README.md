# Minecraft-like_Godot_CSharp
A Minecraft-inspired RPG built in Godot 4.2 with C#.
Instead of a pure sandbox, the focus is on guild progression, village life, and cooperative challenges. Players can join guilds, complete chores, missions, and quests, and take part in raids that shape the future of the village.

Features (planned & in-progress):

- Procedural, block-based world inspired by Minecraft

- Unique guild progression system (miner, explorer, farmer, etc.)

- Daily chores & missions for building reputation

- Large-scale raids & quests

- RPG elements layered on top of voxel-style gameplay
